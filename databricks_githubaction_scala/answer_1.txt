This architecture can be implemented in a cost-effective manner using AWS Glue for the Spark applications, as it is a fully managed, serverless ETL service that charges only for the compute time of the job.

Cost-Optimized Data Processing Architecture
The architecture relies on serverless and managed services to minimize operational overhead and cost, paying only for usage.

Component	AWS Service	Purpose	Cost Benefit/Note
Input Storage (1)	Amazon S3 (Input Bucket)	Stores the daily uploaded Parquet file.	Extremely low-cost, durable object storage.
Spark Application 1 (2)	AWS Glue (Job 1)	Spark Scala job for reading Parquet, transformation, and writing CSV to S3 (Output Bucket).	Serverless: No need to manage clusters (unlike EMR). Pay-per-use based on Data Processing Units (DPU) and job duration. Cost-effective for short, scheduled jobs.
Intermediate Storage (2 & 3)	Amazon S3 (Output Bucket)	Stores the generated CSV file.	Low-cost storage.
Spark Application 2 (3)	AWS Glue (Job 2)	Spark Scala job for reading CSV, preparing JSON payload per record, and executing POST requests to the REST API.	Serverless, Pay-per-use. Glue supports making HTTP calls from within the Spark job (e.g., using Scala's built-in HTTP client libraries or Spark UDFs).
Scheduler (4)	AWS EventBridge (or AWS Glue Workflow)	Configures a daily schedule to trigger the first Glue Job. Glue Workflow can chain Job 1 and Job 2 together.	EventBridge has a generous free tier and low cost for scheduled rules. Glue Workflow is part of the Glue service and helps orchestrate the jobs.
Versioning & CI/CD (5)	GitHub & GitHub Actions	Version control for Scala Spark code and automated build/deployment.	GitHub for hosting the repository. GitHub Actions for compiling the Spark Scala JAR and deploying the Glue Job definition (e.g., updating the script path in S3 and the job configuration).

Deployment and Workflow Steps
Code & Build (GitHub/GitHub Actions):

The Spark Scala code for both jobs resides in a GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions is configured to run on every push (or merge) to the main branch.

The action compiles the Scala Spark code into a single or two separate JAR files.

The action uploads the compiled JAR files to a specific deployment folder in an S3 bucket.

The action uses the AWS CLI (or an equivalent action) to update the AWS Glue Job definition to point to the newly uploaded JAR file.

Job Orchestration (AWS EventBridge / AWS Glue Workflow):

A daily schedule is set up in EventBridge (using a cron expression) to trigger the start of Glue Job 1.

Alternatively, an AWS Glue Workflow can be used to define a dependency: Job 1 runs first, and upon successful completion, it automatically triggers Job 2. This is often cleaner for multi-step ETL.

Data Processing (AWS Glue Jobs):

Glue Job 1 starts, reads the Parquet file from the Input S3 bucket, performs transformations, and writes the CSV output to the Output S3 bucket.

Glue Job 2 starts (triggered by Workflow/Scheduler), reads the CSV file from the Output S3 bucket, and iterates through the records. For each record, it constructs the JSON payload and makes a synchronous or asynchronous POST request to the external REST API.

Real-Time Use Case: Daily Customer Activity Scoring and Notification
Use Case
Automated Daily Customer Engagement Scoring and Outreach

A digital service or e-commerce platform needs to calculate a daily "Engagement Score" for a subset of its active users and then push this score to a backend Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system via API, triggering tailored outreach or offers.

Matching Requirements
Parquet File in S3 (Input Data): A nightly extract from the transactional database creates a Parquet file containing around 10,000 records of daily user activity data (e.g., login count, items viewed, time spent, cart additions) and is uploaded to an S3 bucket at 3:00 AM daily.

Spark Transformation (Job 1): Glue Job 1 (Spark Scala) reads this Parquet file. The transformation logic calculates the Engagement Score for each user based on weighted activity metrics. It outputs a new CSV file containing the UserID, Calculated_Score, and Timestamp to an intermediate S3 bucket.

Spark API Call (Job 2): Glue Job 2 (Spark Scala) reads the CSV file. It iterates through the records and for each user, prepares a JSON payload like {"user_id": "...", "engagement_score": "..."}. It then executes a POST request to the CRM system's REST API endpoint (/api/v1/update-score) to immediately update the user's score and potentially trigger an automated email or notification based on the score.

Scheduled Job: An AWS EventBridge rule or Glue Workflow is set to run the process at a fixed time (e.g., 3:30 AM) every day.

Versioning/CI/CD: The Spark Scala code for score calculation and API interaction is managed in GitHub, with GitHub Actions ensuring that any code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed to the Glue environment.

AWS Components: All infrastructure and services for data storage, processing, and orchestration are managed on AWS.
