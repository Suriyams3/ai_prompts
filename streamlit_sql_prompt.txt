I saw a python project which uses natural language processing to convert prompt into sqlquery and executes it on a sql db and returns the query response. this project uses sqlite3, google generative ai package, streamlit. here there were 2 files created namely sql.py and app.py. The main driver of this project is the app.py which configures streamlit and on submit, it calls the AI model and DB behind the scenes. The sql.py contains logic to create new DB and table and then insert some records into the table. The command that was used to run was streamlit app.py. Once the command is ran, the ui got loaded and when I pass the prompt as input it returns valid response. I am not able to find out how sql.py file is invoked. will you be able to explain?
